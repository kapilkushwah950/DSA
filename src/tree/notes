tree ds
---------
1. tree is a non-linear DS.
2. tree consist of nodes connected by the edges.
3.  IQ why we use tree data structure IQ
    inorder to perform any operation in a linear DS, the time complexity will increase when increase in data.
4.  Terminology
   a. NOde ; A node is an entity that consist key/value and refernce a child nodes
   Edge. it a link between two nodes.
   Root; the top-most node of the tree.
   tree height: Height of tree is the height of root node.
   tree depth: depth of the deepest node is the depth of the tree.

5. Bineary tree
   a. bineary tree is a tree data structre
   b. each parent node can have at-most two child nodes.
   c. each node consist three parts:
      - refrences to the left child
      - data/values
      - refrences to the right child.

   d. Type of bineary tree:
        i.Full bineary tree
          - every  node has either two or no child nodes.
          - it is also known as proper bineary tree.

         ii. Perfact bineary tree.
             -  every internal nodes has a exactly two child nodes and all the nodes are at the same level.

         iii. Complete bineary tree
              - all the child nodes lean towards the left.

    6. tree Traversing
        pre-order tree traversing: root->left->right
